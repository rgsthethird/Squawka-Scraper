# Squawka-Scraper [Deprecated]
Python2 Squawka.com Soccer Stats Scraper. Created 2016.

I used this program to streamline the point tally process, which occurred each week, for my custom  season-long soccer fantasy league. Scoring would take hours to collect data by hand. This was my first non-school project.

The program takes a list of players in text form and outputs all the stats from a given time period in an Excel file.

Considering I no longer use Squawka, I won't be updating this program.
